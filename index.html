                Welcome to my site! I am still building things here as I am transitioning everything to have it's own home. Check back as I will be adding more here, for now 
                the pictures are ony my instagram at <a href ="https://www.instagram.com/jettmickey/?igshid=OGQ5ZDc2ODk2ZA%3D%3D"> jettmickey</a>

            At Studio Alonzo I enjoy crafting things in a more hands on manner using old world techniques and methods. Crafting wood so that it's natural radiance shines through so that 
            it can be enjoyed for many years. Whethere it is a keepsake box, table or anything in between it can be made. I make my own shellac and use a food-safe contact polish to create that age old look with a clean and clean shine.
